Dice Ban is a really convenient way to ban & unban players. This code is an example of utilizing [Dice QuickStore](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin/DiceQuickStore) and [Dice Msg Service](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin/DiceMsgService). By using both of these modules, we can find players in external servers & ban them in game as soon as we run the command! Enter your UserId into the "Verified" table at the top of the script. Place the script in ServerScriptService. You can find the [most recent release here.](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin/DiceBan/releases)

To access the command bar, there's a top right toggle you can press or you can press the backslash key `\` to open the command line. This let's you run either the two current commands:
1. `Ban [username in server/userid]`
2. `Unban [userid]`

Happy banning!
